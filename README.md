## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS relative color syntax
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to make the design responsive without using media queries so I'm most proud of:

```css
.card {
  width: min-content;
}

figcaption {
  width: 25ch;
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- Techniques to make the designs responsive without using media queries
- Further experiment with new CSS features like the relative color syntax

### Useful resources

- [CSS Relative Color Syntax](https://gui-challenges.web.app/relative-colors/dist/) - This helped me understand the basic concept of the CSS relative color syntax.
